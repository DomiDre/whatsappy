# Whatsappy
Fire up a selenium browser, log-in to web whatsapp by the QR code and feel free to interact with whatsapp using python as you like

## Prerequisites
A selenium webdriver is needed and for now only Firefox is supported.
This needs the geckodriver that powers Firefox to be installed.

The recent geckodriver can be found at https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases


On a Linux system move the downloaded geckodriver to /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.


## Install package 
Install package either from PyPi by running 

```
pip install whatsappy
